# About

Neural Style Transfer refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. NST algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks in order to perform the image transformation.

In this project, we generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S).
